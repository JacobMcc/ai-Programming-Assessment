# ai-Programming-Assessment
Repository for Automated Insights' programming assessment given for candidates to the Summer 2018 Data Science Intern program.

The dataset consists of summaries and metadata scraped from Wikipedia for roughly 42,000 movies. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ge8dsb56vv9ofd4/movie_data.csv).

The data is used to answer the following questions:
* What are the 5 most popular genres?
* What words are characteristic of the movie summaries in those genres?
* An empirical observation known as Zipf’s law is often used to describe the distribution of word
frequencies in text corpora. Do you see evidence of Zipf’s law in the summaries?
