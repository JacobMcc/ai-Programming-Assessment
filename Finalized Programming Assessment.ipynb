    "Good news so far! Simply looking at the plot seems to give us an indication that our data follows Zipf's distribution.\n",

    "Quantitatively establishing this relation is somewhat trickier though. Despite being my first impulse, running a regression on the logged empirical data and testing the alternative hypothesis that $\\hat{\\beta}_{1} = -1$ is actually not a statistically sound method according to the literature. See articles *Testing for Zipf’s law: A common pitfall* or *A simple* and *efficient test for Zipf’s law* from Economic Letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead our best route is to use the two-sided __[Kolmogorov–Smirnov test](hhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test)__ (KS). The two-sided KS test quantifies the distance between two empirical distribution functions. Essentially we are testing if two sets of data were drawn from the same distribution. For our two samples we use the ordered counts list created above from the corpus of summaries and the manufactured ordered list that perfectly relates our data as the inverse of its rank. I.e. 2nd index of tuples found in lists $ordered$ and $zipf$ or the data that constitutes the blue and green lines in the above plot.\n",

    "Unfortunately according to the two-sided KS test we reject the null hypothesis with high confidence considering the p-value essentially equals 0. It's important to keep in mind that even though our log-log plot seems to show something very close to a Zipf distribution it's not too difficult to get log-log plots to look very close for varying distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also when we actually look at the empirical counts we can visually tell that it doesn't seem to be very Zipf-like. Early on it has a couple substantial jumps but slows down very quickly and the vast majority of the data actually sees very small differences from one rank to the next."
